# temp-metrics-d-cpp

Temperatura measurement daemon.  

Project generated by `meson init --name temp-metrics-d-cpp --build`

## Dev env setup

Install meson build following [quickstart](https://mesonbuild.com/Quick-guide.html). Installing directly in pip is best because the package manager versions are often outdated. 

### VsCode support

Install extensions asabil.meson, ms-vscode.cpptools.  
Open this directory as the root in VsCode, and check the Meson tab, and meson VsCode tasks


## [Basic build commands](https://mesonbuild.com/Quick-guide.html)

```bash
# Configure ninja build: this creates a directory `build` that can be deleted at any time
# Usin "meson builddir" instead of "meson build" to use directory `builddir` as target
# which is what the VsCode extension is using
# Same as VsCode task "Meson: Configure"
meson builddir

# Build: same as "MEeson_ Build" VsCode task
cd builddir
#   use `ninja` for meson <= 0.55.0
meson compile

# Run tests
meson test
```
